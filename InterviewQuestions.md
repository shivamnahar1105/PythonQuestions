# Python Basic Questions

### 1. 
- Value of True = 1 
- Value of False = 0 
- Value of None is Empty (not even Zero)

### 2. 
- print('' is '') # ---> returns true as string, int, float addrresses to the same memory if the value is same.
- print([] is []) # ---> returns False as list, tuple, dict creates different memories in the backend.
### 3. Difference between return & yield.
- Total keyword in python is 33
- Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values.
  We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don't want to store the entire sequence in memory. Yield are used in Python generators.
- Return gives a single value and yield usually gives a generator object on which we can iterate.
